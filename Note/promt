Figma UI Design Prompt for an English Learning Website
Objective
Design a clean, modern, and user-friendly UI in Figma for an English learning website targeting learners of all levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced). The design should be visually appealing, intuitive, and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. Each key functionality should be organized into separate pages, with a left-aligned sidebar navigation bar for easy access.
Target Audience

Primary Users: English learners (students, professionals, casual learners) aged 16–50, with varying proficiency levels.
Secondary Users: Teachers or tutors looking for resources to support their students.
User Goals: Learn English effectively through interactive lessons, track progress, engage with a community, and access resources like vocabulary exercises, grammar lessons, and speaking practice.

Design Requirements

Style: Modern, clean, and approachable with a professional yet friendly aesthetic.
Color Scheme: Use a vibrant yet calming palette (e.g., blues, whites, and accent colors like orange or green) to evoke trust and motivation.
Typography: Use readable, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Poppins, Roboto, or Open Sans) with clear hierarchy (headings, subheadings, body text).
Responsiveness: Design for both desktop (1440px) and mobile (375px) layouts, ensuring seamless usability across devices. For mobile, collapse the sidebar into a hamburger menu.
Accessibility: Ensure sufficient color contrast, clear navigation, and readable font sizes for accessibility compliance.

Sidebar Navigation

Placement: A fixed left sidebar for desktop, collapsing into a hamburger menu for mobile.
Elements:
Logo at the top of the sidebar.
Navigation links to: Home, Courses, Features, Community, Progress, Blog, Login/Signup.
A search icon for quick content access.
Language switcher at the bottom.


Design Notes: Use icons next to text labels for each nav item. Highlight the active page with a distinct background or border. Ensure the sidebar is 250–300px wide on desktop, with a clean and minimal design.

Pages and Functionalities
Each functionality is now split into dedicated pages, accessible via the sidebar navigation.
